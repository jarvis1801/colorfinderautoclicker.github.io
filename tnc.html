<h1>Terms and Conditions ("Terms")</h1>
<p>Last updated: December 9, 2025</p>

<p>Please read these Terms and Conditions carefully before using the <strong>"Color Finder Auto Clicker"</strong> mobile application (the "Service") operated by Chris Chui ("us", "we", or "our").</p>
<p>Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms.</p>

<h2>1. Acceptance and Use Restrictions</h2>
<p>By downloading or using the app, these terms automatically apply to you. If you disagree with any part of the terms then you may not access the Service.</p>

<h3>1.1. Intellectual Property and Source Code</h3>
<p>The Service and all trademarks, copyright, database rights, and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to Chris Chui.</p>
<ul>
    <li>You are **not allowed to copy, or modify** the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way.</li>
    <li>You are **not allowed to attempt to extract the source code** of the app, translate the app into other languages, or make derivative versions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Auto Clicker and Scripting Disclaimer (Critical Section)</h2>
<div class="disclaimer">
    <h3><strong>CRITICAL RISK WARNING: USER RESPONSIBILITY AND LIABILITY LIMITATION</strong></h3>
    <p>The **Auto Clicker** and scripting features allow you to automate actions on your device. You acknowledge and agree that:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Sole Responsibility:</strong> Any and all scripts, click patterns, settings, or automated commands configured and executed by you using the Service are done so **entirely at your own risk**.</li>
        <li><strong>No Liability for Loss:</strong> We are **not responsible and accept no liability** for any financial loss, data loss, damage to your device, account suspensions (e.g., in third-party games or platforms), or any other damages or consequences, whether direct or indirect, resulting from the execution of any automated command or script you initiate through the Service.</li>
        <li><strong>Third-Party Compliance:</strong> Use of the Auto Clicker may violate the terms of other applications or services. You are **solely responsible** for ensuring your scripts comply with all applicable third-party terms and regulations.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>BY USING THE AUTO CLICKER FEATURE, YOU EXPRESSLY ASSUME FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE CAUSED BY YOUR AUTOMATED SCRIPTS.</strong></p>
</div>

<h2>3. Application Functionality and Service Limitations</h2>

<h3>3.1. Internet Connection and Data Charges</h3>
<p>Certain functions of the app (e.g., retrieving ads, crash reporting) will require an active internet connection. We cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi or sufficient mobile data allowance. You are accepting responsibility for any and all charges incurred from your mobile network provider for data usage, including roaming data charges.</p>

<h3>3.2. Device Security and Operation</h3>
<p>It is your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We recommend that you **do not jailbreak or root your phone**, as this could make your device vulnerable to malware/viruses, compromise security features, and potentially cause the Service to function improperly or not at all.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app. You need to ensure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, we cannot accept responsibility.</p>

<h3>3.3. Warranty Disclaimer</h3>
<p>The app is provided "AS IS," and we accept no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on the functionality of the app.</p>

<h2>4. Advertising, Analytics, and Data Providers</h2>
<p>The app uses third-party services that have their own Terms and Conditions. By using the app, you agree to their respective terms.</p>
<ul>
    <li>**Google Play Services**</li>
    <li>**Google AdMob:** Used for displaying advertisements. AdMob may collect information about your usage to serve relevant ads.</li>
    <li>**Google Firebase (Analytics & Crashlytics):** Used for monitoring app usage, stability, and bug reporting.</li>
</ul>
<p>For details on how your data is collected and processed by these services, please refer to our separate **Privacy Policy**.</p>

<h2>5. Changes and Termination</h2>
<h3>5.1. Changes to the App and Fees</h3>
<p>We reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear what you are paying for.</p>

<h3>5.2. Termination of Use</h3>
<p>We may wish to stop providing the app and may **terminate your use of it at any time without notice**, especially in cases of abuse or misuse of the Auto Clicker functionality or violation of these Terms. Upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and delete it from your device.</p>
<p>You promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you.</p>
